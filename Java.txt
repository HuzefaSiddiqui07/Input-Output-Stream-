Stream
A stream is a sequence of data. In Java, a stream is composed of bytes. 
In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.
1) System.out: This is the standard output stream that is used to produce the result of a program on an output device like the computer screen.
2) System.in: This is the standard input stream that is used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.
3) System.err: This is the standard error stream that is used to output all the error data that a program might throw, on a computer screen or any standard output device.Let's see the code to print output and an error message to the console.
